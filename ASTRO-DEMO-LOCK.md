# ASTRO-DEMO-LOCK

This is the repository-level, fail-closed implementation contract for exact Astro + Tina demo migrations. `TINA-MIGRATION-GOLD.md` is the parent migration and release policy. GOLD must be updated and validated first; this lock receives every mechanically applicable design, browser, data-shape and release control afterward.

A build, SHA, `RELEASE_COMMIT`, HTTP `200`, screenshot taken at the wrong viewport, or verbal review cannot pass this lock. A required check that cannot run is `BLOCKED`, never silently skipped.

## Mandatory controls

1. **NO-PREMATURE-COMPLETION** — Local build, local capture, upload, extraction, restart, marker and route smoke are intermediate checkpoints. Completion requires the immutable live SHA, identical production lock, admin/island proof, cleanup and post-cleanup health.
2. **AUTHORITY-FIRST** — Name and hash one supplied authority before implementation. Reject unrelated themes, inherited designs, destination-derived expectations and approximations.
3. **GATE-SELF-TEST** — Keep a controlled negative mutation for every template family and shared structural area. Each must fail for its intended invariant.
4. **PRODUCTION-DATA-SHAPE** — Preserve wrappers across rich-text objects, strings, absent blocks and fallbacks; test with destination Tina production-shaped data.
5. **DESTINATION-ENV-ONLY** — Start build, preview and validation from a clean child environment containing only the approved destination Tina identity and origin.
6. **FRESH-PROCESS-AND-SHUTDOWN** — Prove PID, cwd and release-specific output; never validate a process that survived a rebuild; close browser work before orderly termination.
7. **SERIAL-BROWSER-GATES** — Run positive, controlled-negative and authenticated browser suites serially and retain each parsed exit result.
8. **RESOURCE-PREFLIGHT** — Measure `/`, `/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, memory and stale browser processes before browser-heavy work; resource exhaustion is a harness failure.
9. **DETERMINISTIC-TOOLCHAIN** — Use explicit verified Node/package-manager paths and record versions; shell-path failures block the build.
10. **PUBLISHER-BEFORE-FINAL-SHA** — Finish reversible Publisher save → backend → unique public reflection → exact restoration before final immutable packaging; post-cutover checks are read-only.
11. **TRUE-ORIGIN-AND-LIVE-PROOF** — Prove authoritative origin/vhost separately from CDN delivery, authenticate through canonical `/admin/`, and require a real authenticated island POST with non-empty query, variables, data and form metadata.
12. **SELF-CONTAINED-RUNTIME-AND-CLEANUP** — Own or explicitly map runtime dependencies; retain required dependency releases; remove stale archives, extraction directories, locks, diagnostics, obsolete links and owned cron jobs.
13. **STRUCTURED-EVIDENCE** — Emit sanitized machine-readable target, timestamp, source hash, final commit, route, viewport, browser dimensions, assertions, screenshot metric, interactions and exit status.
14. **CHECKPOINT-NOT-COMPLETION** — Enforce authority/hash → implementation → Publisher transaction → final branch tip → clean build/secret scan → fresh local positive → local negative → immutable deploy → live fingerprint → live positive → live negative → read-only admin/island → SHA parity → cleanup → post-cleanup health.
15. **MINIMAL-RETRY-DIAGNOSTICS** — Repair malformed methods, URLs, auth flows, shell paths, resource state, server identity and harness configuration before changing product code or weakening assertions.
16. **LITERAL-VISUAL-NON-APPROXIMATION** — Preserve authoritative DOM/classes, declarations, font binaries/axes, colours, dimensions, spacing, imagery, states, breakpoints and interactions exactly. Tina values may differ only inside locked wrappers.
17. **SHA-HTTP-NOT-VISUAL-PROOF** — Build success, process health, matching SHA and HTTP `200` prove identity/availability only; they cannot replace DOM, computed-style, geometry, screenshot, responsive and interaction evidence.
18. **CLOUD-SOURCE-PRECEDENCE** — Run against destination Tina Cloud records and assert field-by-field precedence. Cloud-only editorial body, wrapper or hierarchy drift is a hard failure.
19. **REAL-WHEEL-STICKY-PROOF** — Require computed sticky state plus settled real-wheel geometry over multiple steps and containing-boundary release when practical; in-motion smooth scrolling is invalid evidence.
20. **RESPONSIVE-RAIL-TOC-CONTRACT** — Test both sides of the source breakpoint: desktop preserves the full sticky rail/card/TOC contract; compact/mobile hides it and exposes the intended static in-article TOC.
21. **COMPLETE-TEMPLATE-FAMILY-MATRIX** — Map and test home sections, archives, article, generic/editorial page, contact, sitemap, catch-all/404, CTA, global chrome and every supplied specialty family at all source breakpoints.
22. **FIXTURE-INTEGRITY-FIRST** — Keep authority fixtures outside implementation output with a checked SHA-256 manifest. Require unique normalized manifest paths; reject duplicate entries before hashing. Reject symlinked authority roots, manifests, fixture files or directories; require segment-safe lexical containment plus realpath containment inside the authority root. Enumerate the complete fixture tree and reject every unmanifested file. Reject missing, changed, extra, escaped, symlinked or destination-generated authority before opening a browser.
23. **DUAL-ARTIFACT-SECRET-SCAN** — After the final Tina command and sanitization, scan both completed `dist/` and the exact release archive for protected values, generated credentials, machine paths and `.env` inclusion.
24. **EXACT-SHA-PACKAGE-POINTER-PARITY** — Package from exact full `HEAD`, embed it in `RELEASE_COMMIT`, reopen the archive, and require equality across local HEAD, remote tip, archive marker, physical release and active pointer.
25. **FINAL-POST-CLEANUP-ACCEPTANCE** — After cleanup, rerun route/asset health, pointer/rollback/runtime dependency proof, canonical admin shell and required read-only live lock checks. Final reporting must use this state.
26. **EXECUTABLE-LOCK-READINESS** — Policy markers alone cannot pass this lock. Require validator-enforced executable preflight and controlled-negative preflight, all lock controls, a complete no-extra-file SHA-256 authority manifest, a real positive browser validator, a controlled-negative browser suite and real positive/negative lock commands. Missing authority or browser gates is machine-readable `BLOCKED` with exit `2`; never derive authority from the destination or point the positive lock command only at preflight.

## Transport gates inherited from GOLD

`AUTHENTICATED-GIT-PREFLIGHT`, `PROJECT-SECRET-MAP`, `CPANEL-ENDPOINT-NORMALIZATION` and `CPANEL-RESPONSE-NORMALIZATION` remain transport controls in `TINA-MIGRATION-GOLD.md`. If any prevents live proof, this lock is `BLOCKED`.

## LATEST-MIGRATION-INCIDENT-LEDGER — Herald News Today

The complete `HNT-001` through `HNT-054` problem → solution → prevention → evidence matrix in `TINA-MIGRATION-GOLD.md` is incorporated into this lock by ID and is mandatory here, including transport rows because any transport failure blocks honest live visual proof. The repository validator and lock preflight must require every ID in both documents and must verify the four-column semantics below. This condensed lock ledger preserves the full incident set without weakening any GOLD wording.

This ledger is append-only under the same supersession rule as GOLD. Documentation presence alone still does not pass any row.

## Executable acceptance

Documentation presence is insufficient. The project must implement applicable checks in its source validator, demo-lock, controlled-negative suite, Tina/admin fullcheck, immutable packager/deployer and cleanup verification. The repository validator must reject a missing `ASTRO-DEMO-LOCK.md` or any missing mandatory control above.
